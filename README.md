# Ace-Cloud-RTDS-HACKATHON-2025
Developed for the Ace Cloud x RTDS Hackathon, this project explores Agentic AIâ€”autonomous agents that can plan, reason, and act independently in dynamic environments. It focuses on intelligent decision-making with minimal human input, solving real-world problems through adaptive and goal-oriented behavior.
