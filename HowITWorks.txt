Project Description: AI Cloud Operations Assistant

A) What Does This Code Do?
This is a smart helper that lets you control your cloud (OpenStack) using normal English commands. You can talk to it like a friend, and it will create/delete virtual machines (VMs), networks, and storage automatically.

B)Key Features
1)Talk Like a Human
Example:
You type: "Make a small VM named webserver"
-The AI understands: "Create a VM with flavor 'small' and name 'webserver'"

2)Works with OpenStack Cloud
-Creates VMs, networks, storage
-Resizes or deletes them
-Uses OpenStack’s tools (Nova, Neutron, Cinder)

3)Safety Checks
-Only admins can delete things (VMs, networks, storage)
-Asks "Are you sure?" before deleting anything
-Guides You Step-by-Step

4)If you forget details (like VM size), it asks questions:
-"Which flavor (size) do you want? Options: small, medium, large"

5)Keeps a Diary
-Saves all commands and results in a database (requests.db)


C) How It Works:
Step 1: You Type a Command

Example: "Delete the VM named test"

Step 2: AI Understands You

Uses Google’s Gemini AI to:

Guess what you want to do (create/delete/resize)

Find details (name, size, network) in your command

Step 3: Ask Missing Details

If you forget something:

"Which network should the VM use? Options: private-net, public-net"

Step 4: Check Permissions

If you try to delete something:

Checks if you’re an admin

If not: "Sorry, only admins can delete things!"

Step 5: Confirm Dangerous Actions

For deletions:

"WARNING: This will delete 'test' forever! Type 'y' to confirm."

Step 6: Do the Work

Talks to OpenStack to:

Create VMs/networks/storage

Resize VMs

Delete things (if allowed)

Step 7: Save Results

Keeps a record of everything in a database.
